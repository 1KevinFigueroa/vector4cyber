## Purpose:
Modern cyber operations generate massive, high‑dimensional data, alerts, asset inventories, scan results, DNS and
TLS telemetry, threat intel feeds, and more. Most teams still force this data into legacy, row‑and‑column patterns that were
never designed for AI‑driven analysis. This talk presents a practical approach to modernize, vectorize, and visualize your
cyber operations data using the Qdrant vector database as the core of a next‑generation threat intelligence and recon platform.

## Abstract:
We will walk through how to transform heterogeneous cyber data (from tools like Nmap, Amass, sslscan, passive DNS, and OSINT
sources) into embeddings that capture semantic relationships-between assets, indicators, behaviors, and attack paths-instead of just static fields. Once vectorized, Qdrant enables fast similarity search, context‑aware pivoting (e.g., “find assets that
behave like this compromised host”), and automated clustering for campaign or infrastructure grouping. On top of that, we will
show how to leverage Qdrant’s filtering and metadata capabilities to combine classic threat hunting (by IP, ASN, tags, exposure) with vector search workflows.

## Description:
The session will include live examples of: building a small open‑source cyber dataops pipeline around Qdrant; mapping external
attack surface and TLS posture into vectors; and visualizing neighborhoods of risky assets using dimensionality reduction and
graph‑style views to support recon and threat modeling. Attendees will leave with concrete patterns, schema ideas, and
code‑level concepts they can immediately apply to replace brittle dashboards and ad‑hoc spreadsheets with a scalable, AI‑ready, vector‑driven threat intel backbone.
